# What should you place in your plugins?

When building an application we want to try and always use the schema form engine to manage our primary layout and pages.
In some cases complex components require custom solutions and these components you can build as plugin components.
In most cases you should be able to compose your form widgets as plugins if they require special formatting or interfacing.

## What is in the reactory core plugin?
The plugin contains the default core components a basic application would need. Users, Employee, Organization, Business Unit and
several other utility forms as well as the Froala wysiwyg editor. There are also some experimental forms and some developer utility forms.
